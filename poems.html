    <p class="text-lg text-[#967c65] font-serif">
      Sometimes speaking becomes difficult for me to process some emotions kept inside of my own mind. So poetry has healed me slowly by time.
      I develpod my emotional intelligence with simple and short poems when I'm angry, sad, confused or empty. Or even inspired towards something I feel.
      My poems are written mainly by emotions or reflections. Otherwise, I can't place much around, because I'm an emotional person.
      These are some poems I've written over the years and although it's my privacy, I like to share my way of poetry to others.

              <p class="text-[#210F04] font-serif">"In the quiet of the night, when shadows softly creep,
                I find myself lost in thoughts, in memories so deep.
                Your laughter echoes in my mind, your smile lights up my soul,
                But you're no longer by my side, and it takes its toll.
                
                I trace the lines of our story, etched in every tear,
                The moments shared, the dreams we dared, now distant and unclear.
                Your absence weighs upon my heart, a burden hard to bear,
                For I can't seem to let you go, you're everywhere.
                
                In every whispered breeze, I hear your name anew,
                In every star that fills the sky, I see reflections of you.
                Though miles may lie between us, and time may blur our past,
                Your presence lingers in my heart, a love that's meant to last.
                
                So here I am, in solitude, holding onto you,
                In memories woven like threads of gold, in dreams that still ring true.
                For even though you're far away, and time may march ahead,
                You'll always be a part of me, in every word unsaid.
                
                Until the day we meet again, beneath the endless sky,
                I'll hold onto the love we shared, and never say goodbye."</p>

              <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2"> Dear Time</h3>
              <p class="text-[#210F04] font-serif">"Time, a shadow that lingers near,  
                A fleeting echo, soft but clear.  
                It slips through fingers, fine as sand,  
                A restless tide, a gentle hand.  
                
                I reach for it, this golden thread,  
                In memories past, in tears I've shed.  
                A wistful ache, a longing deep,  
                For moments lost, for dreams I keep.  
                
                It dances lightly on the breeze,  
                A fleeting touch, a subtle tease.  
                Promising tomorrows that never stay,  
                Yet stealing yesterdays away.  
                
                Time, a lover I cannot hold,  
                Both cruelly swift and bittersweetly bold.  
                It mends, it breaks, it heals the scar,  
                A distant light, a guiding star.  
                
                Oh, Time, my heart beats to your song,  
                I chase you fast, but you move on.  
                And yet, within your endless flow,  
                You teach me life, to love, to grow.  
                
                So stay, if only for a while,  
                Grant me one more fleeting smile.  
                For though you're gone, you'll always be,  
                The pulse of life, eternity."</p>

                <p class="text-[#210F04] font-serif">"In a world of noise, I seek my peace,
                  But each sound assaults, it never cease.
                  Sensory storms rage within my mind,
                  In a symphony chaotic, hard to unwind.
                  
                  Faces blur, expressions unknown,
                  Navigating emotions, like seeds unsown.
                  In a sea of words, I search for my voice,
                  Yet often it's lost, drowned in the noise.
                  
                  Routine, my anchor, in a world unkind,
                  Predictability, solace, a haven I find.
                  Yet expectations loom, misunderstood,
                  In a labyrinth of rules, where I'm often misunderstood.
                  
                  Connections elusive, like stars in the night,
                  Yearning for warmth, for a guiding light.
                  Yet in solitude, I often find my truth,
                  In the depths of my being, where dreams take root.
                  
                  Though the path is challenging, fraught with strife,
                  In the tapestry of life, I carve my own life.
                  For in every struggle, a strength does rise,
                  A spirit resilient, reaching for the skies.
                  
                  So let us embrace, in our diversity,
                  For within each soul lies a unique tapestry.
                  Though the journey may be tough, we'll find our way,
                  In the beauty of being, every single day."</p>
