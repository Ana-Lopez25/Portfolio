                <p class="text-[#210F04] font-serif"> Usually I spend my free time with dance classes, walks around near by forests and if i feel inspired... 
                  Maybe I'll paint something in the moment. Have a old habit since I was little to take photos. Because since I was small, I liked to capture moments where others wouldn't see but I felt connected to.
                Like a memory only I saw and collect for further events. To maintain the feeling where it was placed, a destiny placed for me to take. 
              Anyways, I also love to play videogames, specially on my Playstation 4. Where I spend most of my childhood playing along with my older brother.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Personality:</h3>
                    <p class="text-[#210F04] font-serif">Well.. Whenever someone tells me something about my personality, they I'm unique. Not in a bad way because I also see myself as special and unique. We all can be in our ways. 
                      But kind, gentle, talkative also cames along. Since it's a force of habit to be friendly around people. Oh! I'm also a bit antisocial whenever I don't have the desire to speak to anyone. I turn off my mind and only express my needs. 
                      People say I have a golden heart. Not a trait but it can be because it describes a lot about someone, so yeah.

                      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Facts:</h3>
                      <p class="text-[#210F04] font-serif"> I completed a 105km path through Spain called 'Caminho de Santiago'. 
                        Even tho, in the beginning, I wasn't fond of it.. I still haven't regret it going in this experience. Hopefully in the future, I get to do it again. 
                        I have many siblings, one is older than me by 3 years (22 years old), the other two are much younger. One is 5 years old and the youngest is 2 years old. 
                        Lastly, not a good fact but still.. it's about my person. I have a hyperfixation about videogames. Mainly about story games, it's an addiction I can't over.
